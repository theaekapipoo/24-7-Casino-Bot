## Acceptance of Terms
By using 24/7 Casino ("the Bot"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"), as well as Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). Your use of the Bot signifies your acceptance of these Terms.

## 1. Name and Nature of the Service
"24/7 Casino" is a chosen brand name and does not imply that our services are actual casino services or available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our platform is solely for virtual gaming and entertainment, with no real-world gambling or financial implications.

## 2. Usage
The Bot is intended for use as a virtual game with no real stakes involved. It's designed for entertainment only, and we do not accept responsibility for any consequences, whether in real life or within the virtual environment, that arise from your use of the Bot.

## 3. Prohibited Uses
You agree not to use the Bot for any unlawful purposes, including but not limited to:
- Exploiting the Bot for financial gain.
- Attempting to manipulate or exploit any vulnerabilities in the Bot's code.
- Using self-bots, macros, or any automated systems to interact with the Bot.
- Engaging in any activity that disrupts, interferes with, or negatively impacts the Bot or its services.

## 4. Virtual Currency
The Bot uses a virtual currency ("Coins" or "Credits") for its games. These Coins/Credits have no real-world value and cannot be exchanged for real currency, goods, or services. Purchases made within the Bot are for enhancing the virtual gaming experience only and are not considered real-world financial transactions.

## 5. Account Termination
We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Bot at any time, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including but not limited to violation of these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Bot will immediately cease.

## 6. Links to Other Web Sites
The Bot may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.

## 7. Changes to Terms
We may modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing to use the Bot after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Bot is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of the Bot or any related services.

## 10. Contact Us
For questions about these Terms, please contact us on the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/nXjzVHe2Ez).

## 11. Refund Policy and Consequences
All transactions within the Bot are final and non-refundable. Requesting or processing a refund will result in an immediate and permanent ban from using the Bot and its services.

## 12. Circumvention of Currency Transfer Limits

### 12.1 Prohibition of Circumvention
Users are strictly prohibited from engaging in activities that intentionally circumvent the established limits on currency transfers within the Bot. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Facilitating the transfer of virtual currency beyond the set daily limits through indirect means, such as intentionally losing in games or matches to transfer currency.
- Using any method or strategy to bypass or exploit the Bot’s limitations on currency transfers for any purpose, including tax evasion or other financial gains.

### 12.2 Monitoring and Enforcement
We actively monitor for and investigate suspicious or unusual activities that suggest an attempt to circumvent currency transfer limits. We reserve the right to take appropriate action against any user found to be engaging in such activities. This may include, but is not limited to, temporary or permanent suspension of access to the Bot, forfeiture of virtual currency, and/or other penalties as deemed necessary.

### 12.3 No Loopholes
There shall be no exceptions or loopholes to this policy, unless given explicit permission by the owner of the Bot. All users are expected to adhere to the transfer limits as they are a fundamental part of the Bot’s operation and governance. Any attempts to find or exploit perceived loopholes without such explicit permission will be treated as a violation of these Terms.

### 12.4 Reporting Mechanism
Users are encouraged to report any activities or behaviors that they suspect may involve the circumvention of currency transfer limits. Reports can be made anonymously and will be thoroughly investigated to ensure the integrity of the Bot.

## Data Storage and Usage
By using the Bot, you consent to our data storage and usage policies. We collect and store data including, but not limited to, your Discord ID, your interaction history with the Bot, and other relevant usage data. This information is used for the operation and continuous improvement of the Bot's services.

## Severability
If any part of these Terms is held to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder remains valid and enforceable.

## Acceptance of Future Changes
Your continued use of 24/7 Casino after changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of the new Terms. We encourage regular review of the Terms.

By using the Bot, you acknowledge your understanding and agreement to these Terms of Service, including our data storage and usage policies.
